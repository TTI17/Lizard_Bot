# ðŸ¦Ž Lizard Telegram Bot.
The bot has several commands for both administrators and users without rights.

## Descriptions
Admin bot by howkiy is a multifunctional tool for managing your Telegram community. 

It allows you to automate many processes, improve moderation and speed up work with participants. 

*With it, you can optimize your workflow and make your group or channel more successful.*

This bot has been developed for a long time and is being refined.

The bot is completely written in Python

Such as:
## __Administrator commands__

- !ban - *bans the user forever*
- !unban - *unbans the user and sends him an unban message*
- !get_admin - *gives administrator rights to the user*
- !mute - *mutes the user for a certain period*  
~~ !content - get a schedule of participants' activity ~~ (in development)
## __Commands for regular users__
- !report - *sends a report to the administrator as a message.*

## What's new
- [x] - database in json-file added database.py file, which collects user data using messages.
## Ideas
__Next thing I want to do__:
- [ ] - add a function to collect the number of messages for a certain amount of time in graph(for example, per day)
- [ ] - censorship of messages and removal of objectionable content
